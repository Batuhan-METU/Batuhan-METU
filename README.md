<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Batuhan!</h1>


⊛⊛⊛ Hello! I'm Batuhan Basoda, currently studying Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University(METU). I have a strong passion for programming and love exploring the world of computer science 🧑‍💻. From writing clean code to understanding complex algorithms, I’m always motivated to learn, create, and share my projects with dear GitHub community 🐙.  

⊛⊛⊛  Outside of programming, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places and cultures, which inspires me with different perspectives 🌍. Also I'm a huge movie & TV Series enthusiast, I like talking about them for hours 🎬!

⊛⊛⊛  From a sports perspective, I really enjoy playing and watching football, which is one of my favorite ways to relax, have fun, and stay active ⚽. 

⊛⊛⊛  You can explore my projects and code in different programming languages across my repositories 🛠️, including both completed work and projects I’m actively developing.
